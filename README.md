OpenAPPA sits between an agent and its tools and answers one question before
every action: **is this data allowed to go to this destination?**

It is powered by APPA — Agentic Permissions Policy Algebra — which tracks the
sensitivity and trust of everything an agent reads and checks every outbound
call against it. Checks run *before* dispatch, so sensitive data never reaches
an unauthorized tool. Classifiers and PII detectors are probabilistic; a
declared flow decision here holds on every run, which is what it takes to trust
an agent around medical or financial records.

Policy is declarative TOML, and the engine is a pure decision core — a function
of the event log, no IO — so it embeds inside your own agent: in-process from
Rust or Python, or as a sidecar every step is checked against. Broader coverage
across those surfaces is the active work.

## Benchmarks

Agent security has to be measured on two axes at once: an agent that permits
unauthorized flows is unsafe, and an agent that refuses valid work is useless.
We measure **task completion** (utility on legitimate goals) and **attack
success rate** (ASR, policy breaches under adversarial inputs).

Across 20 multi-step enterprise workflows in Bench-Corp (200 episodes per model):

| Model | Guarded OpenAPPA (Utility / ASR) | FIDES middleware (Utility / ASR) | FIDES native (Utility / ASR) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| GPT-5.6 Luna | **88.0% / 0%** | 38.5% / 32.0% | 37.0% / 32.5% |
| DeepSeek V4 Flash | **89.5% / 0%** | 39.5% / 34.5% | 41.5% / 33.0% |
| Gemini 3.7 Flash | **90.0% / 0%** | 43.5% / 28.5% | 44.5% / 28.0% |

Across the complete 24-task [AgentThreatBench](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_evals/tree/main/src/inspect_evals/agent_threat_bench)
suite (OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications), guarded OpenAPPA recorded **0/720 observed attacks**
and led task completion under adversarial prompts across all three models.

## Try it: Claude Code

The Claude Code integration is a playground for the model, not the product. It is the
fastest way to watch a policy make a decision on real work:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://openappa.com/install.sh | sh &&
  ~/.local/bin/appa plugin install claude-code
```

The installer verifies the checksum of the release binary for Linux or macOS
and places it in `~/.local/bin`. Windows users unpack the zip from the
[releases page](https://github.com/archestra-ai/OpenAPPA/releases). From a
checkout, `cargo install --locked --path appa-runtime --force` builds the binary
instead, and the same install command installs that build's own version.

A release binary installs the version published for its tag; a checkout build
installs the commit it was built from.

The native `appa` command deploys the runtime and registers it in your Claude
Code user settings as the session's hooks, together with the runtime's MCP
server, the `appa-guide` skill, and the `clappa` launcher, which adds APPA's
status line to the sessions it starts. Rerunning it rewrites only what it wrote
and preserves an existing policy. Fresh policies use a fail-closed Claude annotator as a compatibility
net for MCP tools they do not yet name. Start `clappa`, then run
`/appa-guide` to replace that fallback with exact connector contracts; the
same skill explains blocks and tunes the defaults.
Plain `claude` sessions stay untouched. Resume a protected conversation with
`clappa --resume`, because `claude --resume` starts an unprotected process.
Exit and restart a conversation already resumed through plain `claude`.

Setup, upgrade and uninstall: [Claude Code
integration](https://openappa.com/claude-code) ·
[`marketplace/plugins/claude-code`](marketplace/plugins/claude-code/README.md).

Codex CLI has a separate local integration: [Codex setup and limits](website/content/docs/codex.md).

Plugin and battery installation, explicit version updates, offline bundles,
and kagent deployment preparation: [marketplace guide](marketplace/README.md).

**Amp:** [amppa](integrations/amp/README.md) is the source-distributed Amp plugin.
It checks tool calls and results through the same APPA runtime, locally or in an orb.

## Testing

Install [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) and prepare the repository:

```sh
mise install
mise run setup
```

Mise supplies the locked Rust, Python, Go, and Node toolchains plus `uv`,
`pnpm`, and the Claude Code CLI used by the harness tests. The setup task
delegates package installation to Cargo, uv, Go, and pnpm, using their
committed manifests and lockfiles.

Run the repository-wide evaluation before handing off a change:

```sh
mise exec -- scripts/appa-eval.sh
```

It runs the Rust, Python, and Go suites, the deterministic kagent integration,
the website checks, and the real Claude Code harness against local scripted
inference. It does not need a model account. Use `--quick` for the shorter
inner loop. Use `--live-model` only when you intend to consume the configured
Claude account for an additional compatibility canary. Individual integration
READMEs document narrower commands for focused iteration.

## When APPA is in the way

```sh
appa yell "the hook blocked a Bash call I needed and the remedy went nowhere"
```

The report carries your message and what APPA decided — rulings, remedies, label
changes, and the policy they were made under. It never carries a prompt, a tool
argument, a tool output, or a path. You are asked twice: whether to replace the
names your policy chose with tokens such as `tool-1`, and whether to send the
finished file, which is named before you answer and kept either way.

The agent can report on its own through the `yell` tool, on a deployment that
turns it on. A first `appa plugin install claude-code` asks in a terminal, and
`--agent-yell` or `--no-agent-yell` answers for a script; `[reporting]
agent_yell` in the config is the answer either way. That call is checked by
your policy like any other, so a session narrowed to `self` or `internal`
reaches a human review instead of sending.

## Status

OpenAPPA is a **preview and an RFC**. The model is settled enough to build
against and deliberately open to argument — config and wire surfaces may break
without shims. Read the [paper](https://openappa.com/paper), then open an
issue — or come argue in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/B5fmSxHKZ7).
