//! # appa-eventlog — the trajectory log, and where it is kept
//!
//! A root trajectory and its branches append to one shared log. That log holds two streams at
//! one position: the engine's lasting facts, and the host's own observations — what a harness
//! saw of its inventory, its calls, its turns and the standing it recorded for them. The stored
//! policy files are the only other durable state, and
//! everything else — a branch's parent, whether it has ended, which dispatch is open, whether an
//! offer still stands — is read back from the log by the engine's projection.
//!
//! This crate is where the log is written and read. The record encoding, the database, and the
//! conditional append are private to it: a caller hands it [`Fact`]s and gets [`Log`]s back, and
//! never names SQL, a row, or a byte. Where the log is kept is the closed [`Backend`] enum,
//! dispatched by `match`: SQLite for standalone use and optional PostgreSQL for
//! embedded hosts that install the schema through their own migrations.
//!
//! Five tables:
//!
//! - the log itself, one row per appended batch, keyed by the root trajectory;
//! - the stored policy files, content addressed by the SHA-256 of their exact bytes, write-once
//!   and shared by every root that opened under them;
//! - the host keys, one row per (key, root) pair a host record ever named, written in the
//!   same transaction as the record that names it. This is the one derived table: it answers
//!   which families stand behind a key without a pass over every family's rows, and it cannot
//!   disagree with the log because a record and its key row commit or roll back together;
//! - operations and processed results — typed receipts for idempotent claims. They are not
//!   engine facts. SQLite and Memory keep them beside the log; PostgreSQL hosts install the
//!   equivalent `openappa_*` tables through their own migrations.
//!
//! ### Storage Backend Scope & Retention
//!
//! Typed receipts (`operations`, `processed_results`) hold idempotent claim state across process
//! restarts. SQLite persists them in the daemon's database file; Memory holds them until the
//! store drops. PostgreSQL embedding hosts install the same contract as `openappa_operations`
//! and `openappa_processed_results`.
//!
//! There is no index from a branch to its root. Every caller already knows the root: a harness
//! event names it, and a surfaced offer's identity carries it. An index would be a third place
//! for the truth to live.
//!
//! ## The compare-and-swap is a value, not a number
//!
//! An append is accepted only if the log still stands where the decision was computed. Here
//! that position is not a number a caller supplies but the [`Log`] it read: [`LogStore::append`]
//! takes the very value the decision was made against. [`Log`] has no public constructor, so a
//! basis cannot be forged, and appending against a position that was never read cannot be
//! written down.
//!
//! ## What this crate does not do
//!
//! It never judges. It stores what the engine produced and returns what it stored. A log whose
//! records do not form a legal history is refused by the engine's transition validator when the
//! log is next read, not here: serialization removes the in-process seal, and
//! re-validation on read is the gate.
