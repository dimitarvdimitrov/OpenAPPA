//! What the harness's own records say about one family right now.
//!
//! The engine reads its facts back from the log, and so does everything the runtime knows
//! about an actor: who stands behind a key, what is executing, which actor a prompt reached,
//! and which tools a host has reported. This module is the reducer over one family's host
//! records — [`HostState::fold`] and the projections beside it — so the runtime holds no
//! actor state between calls and a restart loses none of it.
//!
//! Every rule here is about *liveness*: a record is not a state, and the state is what the
//! records that follow it have not ended.
