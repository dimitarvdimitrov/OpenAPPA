//! One trajectory's decision record, stripped for export.
//!
//! This is what a yell carries when it carries a trajectory: the engine's own facts and the
//! runtime's own events, both walked against [`super::tables`], plus the topology and the
//! trust ranks a reader needs to make sense of them. No prompt, no argument, no tool output,
//! no path, and — under [`Mode::Pseudonymized`] — no name the deployment chose.
//!
//! ## Why the facts are bounded by bytes and not by a count
//!
//! A count is not a bound: fifty thousand facts carrying large arguments are gigabytes before
//! the first one is stripped. So the builder walks the log twice. The first pass runs
//! newest-first with a throwaway token map, keeping nothing but a running byte total, to find
//! the oldest fact that still fits [`MAX_FACT_BYTES`]. The second runs from there oldest-first
//! with the real map, so the export is in log order and token numbers follow first appearance.
//! One stripped fact is live at a time in the first pass.
//!
//! Be exact about what that bounds, because it is easy to claim more. It bounds the *facts*
//! this builder materializes, to within the width of a token's ordinal — the two passes number
//! tokens in opposite orders, so `tool-9` in one may be `tool-12` in the other, and
//! [`ENTRY_OVERHEAD`] is an estimate of each entry's framing rather than a measurement. It
//! does not bound the runtime events, which arrive already bounded by the event log's own
//! byte cap and are cloned out from under its mutex. And it is not a bound on the emitted
//! document: the envelope a report sends is measured and trimmed against the receiver's real
//! limits, gzipped, after this builder has run.
