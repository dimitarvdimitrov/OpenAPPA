//! The engine boundary: the one module that speaks to `appa-engine`.
//!
//! [`RuntimeEngine::rebuild_view`] turns the store's opaque batch rows back into
//! typed facts and refuses the log before it is trusted: the log opens under
//! this root's own policy, and
//! [`appa_engine::engine::Engine::view`] then admits every record through the
//! engine's one sequential transition validator, so a log whose records could
//! not have followed one another never reaches a decision. Because
//! this runtime stores no view and rebuilds from the durable log on every
//! event, that decode step is the store-reopen trust
//! gate. [`RuntimeEngine::handle`] then translates one runtime event onto
//! [`appa_engine::engine::Engine::handle`], the engine's one mutation
//! boundary, and translates its typed follow-up back into a delivery. It
//! returns one decision: an optional fact batch to append under
//! compare-and-swap plus the follow-up the session delivers. The
//! vocabulary here is delivery adaptation, not policy: every
//! admissibility judgment is the engine's.
//!
//! Beside `handle` the boundary makes projection reads — which branch has ended,
//! which dispatches it has open, what its label renders as. They gate nothing
//! and append nothing. One of them is not a read at all:
//! [`RuntimeEngine::opens_a_second_dispatch`] supports the runtime's legacy
//! host policy for events without call identities. The engine deliberately
//! does not impose that policy.
//!
//! External evidence is typed before it reaches an engine input:
//! an authority verdict, a sanitizer derivation, an annotation answer, or a
//! membership answer.
//! A missing or malformed answer stays runtime-side and fails closed
//! — no no-answer variant ever enters an engine operation.
//!
//! Offers are engine-derived remedies and engine-owned facts: the runtime
//! holds no offer state of its own, so a restart loses none of them. The
//! trajectory that may execute one comes from the harness channel carrying
//! the control act, never from the id; the quoted id is resolved
//! against the offers that trajectory's own log opened. Execution re-derives
//! the plan from the live views and matches it by value, so an offer whose
//! basis has moved declines instead of executing.
