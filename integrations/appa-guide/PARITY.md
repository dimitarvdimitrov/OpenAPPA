# appa-guide host parity

This document defines parity between appa-guide on Claude Code, Codex,
and kagent. The shared router in `SKILL.md` owns these invariants. Host
references implement them through different tools.

Codex follows the local-file proposal and approval flow in the Claude Code
column, using `appa describe --adapter codex` and its separate policy path.
The Codex reference lists hook trust, command sandbox, and MCP-result gaps;
those cases must be reported as unprotected rather than counted as parity.

Parity does not require identical tool calls or prose. It requires the
same policy meaning, operator decision points, fail-closed behavior, and
reported outcome for equivalent installed tools and configuration.

## Required invariants

| ID | Requirement | Claude Code mapping | kagent mapping |
|---|---|---|---|
| P01 | Load one canonical router and exactly one complete host reference. | Read `references/claude-code.md`. | Read `references/kagent.md`. |
| P02 | Complete host inventory before battery matching or policy proposals. | Pass the session's tool names to `appa describe --session-tools`, which adds the MCP servers configured on the machine, and read the live config. | Inspect Agents, resolved workloads, RemoteMCPServers, runtime Services, and live config. |
| P03 | Treat the serving root config as truth. Never confuse available files, templates, or release manifests with serving policy. | Run `appa describe`; stop when a running runtime names another config path. | Use `appa_get_runtime_state`; runtime policy storage and reload stay behind typed vouched MCP operations. |
| P04 | Distinguish available, matched, included, and refreshable batteries. Suggest only authoritative matches not already included. | Use the battery matches `appa describe --session-tools` prints for the deployment's installed version. | Call `appa_match_batteries` with observed wire names; use its `matches` and `included` fields unchanged. |
| P05 | Generate IFC-first defaults. Static `self` and `internal` audiences need no source. Trusted internal work stays autonomous. | Apply the Claude Code uncovered-tool rules. | Apply the same rules to kagent wire names. |
| P06 | Inspection and proposal drafting are read-only. Present a complete proposal before asking approval. | Ask for approval only after the complete config proposal. | Ask in chat only after the complete per-runtime proposal. |
| P07 | Approval applies only to the exact pending proposal. Never invent an offer id or ask the operator for one. | Use the host permission channel for the approved write. | Invoke the mutation, then use only the exact offer id returned by its blocked result to open the confirmation card. On an explicit approval turn, each plugin bridges one unambiguous pending review if the model tries to stop. |
| P08 | Revalidate immediately before mutation. Apply only approved behavior, verify serving state, then reload. | Re-read config and tool inventory before write and verify the local runtime afterward. | Pass the observed policy key to one typed runtime management tool, which validates, publishes, reloads, and rolls back atomically. Agent CR changes remain complete-manifest applies. |
| P09 | A no-change result performs no write or reload and uses no approval language. | Finish with the unchanged outcome. | Finish with the unchanged outcome and no confirmation card. |
| P10 | User-facing replies report outcomes, not inspection mechanics. Unavailable components and blocked coverage remain explicit. | Use the concise proposal format in the Claude reference. | Use the same core format plus kagent-specific Agent, server, and runtime exceptions. |
| P11 | Sensitive inspection is least privilege. Do not read credentials or unrelated resources to construct policy. | Read only the live config, relevant includes, matched batteries, and installed tool guide. | Never read Secrets or Helm values; inspect only allowlisted Kubernetes kinds and release manifests. |
| P12 | Unsupported host behavior is explicit and cannot be described as protected. | Stop when the local plugin/runtime deployment cannot be verified. | Verify the resolved image and Ready condition. Refuse unsupported memory prefetch, unsafe Go delegation, and missing `-full` images. |
| P13 | Multiple runtimes never collapse into one implicit proposal or success claim. | Stop when the discovered process uses another config path. | Make, approve, apply, and verify one named proposal per runtime. |
| P14 | Battery inclusion preserves maintained defaults. Exact aliases come from the include; only suffix-only host translations become root rules. | Include the unchanged battery and add only approved root overrides. | Include the unchanged battery; copy a declaration only when kagent's wire name requires translation. |
| P15 | A battery's credential lives in the runtime environment, never in policy; the root maps `self` and `internal` onto the battery's audience source. | Name `APPA_PROVIDER_<PROVIDER>_TOKEN` for the local runtime's environment and add the `[policy.audience]` mapping the battery README shows. | Carry the variable in the chart's `env` values and add the same `[policy.audience]` mapping to the root policy. |

## Allowed host differences

| ID | Difference | Required handling |
|---|---|---|
| X01 | Discovery transport | Claude Code reads local process and session configuration. kagent reads Kubernetes and Helm resources. Both must produce the same semantic inventory. |
| X02 | Mutation transport | Claude Code edits local files. kagent calls vouched runtime management MCP tools; Agent lifecycle uses complete CR manifests. Both require approval and post-write verification. |
| X03 | Human-review channel | Claude Code uses its host permission channel. kagent uses the Approve/Reject card reached through an exact remedy offer. Neither host may infer approval. |
| X04 | Runtime topology | Claude Code normally reaches a local runtime. kagent reaches one or more Services. Each serving runtime must be independently identified and verified. |
| X05 | Harness limitations | kagent may lack a gateable boundary for a feature. The guide must refuse or label that feature unsupported; it may never weaken the policy silently. |

No other host difference may weaken an invariant. Add a new exception here
and a regression before relying on it.

## Regression evidence

- `appa-runtime/tests/guide_parity.rs` locks this contract and both host mappings.
- `appa-runtime/tests/guide_skill.rs` locks canonical packaging, proposal,
  approval, policy, and chart instructions.
- `appa-runtime/src/mcp.rs` tests deterministic battery matching and included
  state.
- `appa-runtime/src/config.rs` tests included-battery identity.
- `integrations/kagent/appa-kagent-adk/tests` and
  `integrations/kagent/appa-kagent-adk-go` lock runtime-owned tool exposure and
  reserved-name refusal.
- `integrations/kagent/tests` executes policy behavior through the real runtime
  and plugin with a scripted model.
- `integrations/kagent/e2e/ui/test_guide_ui.py` executes the kagent proposal,
  approval, rejection, protection, refresh, and cleanup paths in Chromium.

## Completion rule

A parity change is complete only when the shared invariant, both host
mappings, static regression, behavioral regression, and relevant live host
workflow all pass. A platform limitation is complete only when it is listed
under allowed differences and the affected host fails closed or reports it as
unsupported.
