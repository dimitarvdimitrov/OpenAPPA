A trajectory retains its opening policy and accepted tool identities.",
  "<family>/<namespace>/<tool>":

    "An ordered tool contract selector. Every argument:pattern clause must match its top-level argument: a string, or a non-empty array whose every element is a matching string. OpenAPPA uses the first matching contract in authored order, including overlapping native and canonical names. An asterisk matches any argument text; a bare name is the fallback for that tool. If no explicit contract matches, the policy wildcard routes the call through its annotator. A matched contract's schema error does not fall through. A sanitizer rewrite selecting another contract is judged under that contract.",
  delta:
    "The label contribution of an admitted call result. A delta never expands permissions: it intersects reader sets, lowers the trust rank, or leaves the trajectory label unchanged.
