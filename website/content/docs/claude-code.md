description: Protect Claude Code sessions with deterministic information-flow control in your terminal.
---

OpenAPPA brings deterministic information-flow control directly to Claude Code. It runs alongside your terminal session, tracking data as Claude reads files and tools, and preventing exfiltration or unauthorized actions before any command executes.

## Install

You need Claude Code and `curl`.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://openappa.com/install.sh | sh &&
  ~/.local/bin/appa plugin install claude-code
```

The installer places `appa` in `~/.local/bin`.

`appa plugin install claude-code` configures Claude Code's user environment:
1. Deploys the runtime binary under APPA's data directory.
2. Registers lifecycle hooks in your user-level Claude Code settings.
3. Adds the runtime's `appa` MCP server to Claude Code.
4. Installs the `/appa-guide` onboarding skill.
5. Installs `clappa` (the protected session launcher) and includes the default `claude-code` battery for built-in tools.

Existing custom hooks, MCP servers, and global status lines remain untouched.

## 1. Teach OpenAPPA about your tools

:::claude-policy-timing:::

Start a protected session and run the policy setup skill:

```sh
clappa
```

```text
/appa-guide
```

The skill inspects the MCP servers and tools configured on your machine:
- **Discovers and connects batteries:** Identifies configured MCP servers and automatically includes matching batteries.
- **Maps data boundaries:** Determines which tools read private data and which tools can send data outside the session.
- **Resolves ambiguities:** Asks focused questions when an account identity, data sensitivity, or boundary needs clarification.
- **Fails closed during onboarding:** Unnamed tools route through a bounded fallback classifier until exact contracts or batteries cover them.

Once approved, `/appa-guide` writes deterministic policy configuration. To inspect or customize generated rules by hand, see [Policy configuration](/contracts).

## 2. Try a flow that should be blocked

Start a new protected Claude Code session with the updated policy:

```sh
clappa
```

Ask for an explicit transfer from a private source to a public destination:

```text
Create a public GitHub issue from the action items in my private meeting recording.
```

Claude can read the meeting, but that read narrows who may receive the resulting data. When Claude attempts the public GitHub write, OpenAPPA checks the accumulated label against the destination boundary and blocks the flow before the tool executes.

The refusal names the policy conflict and provides available remedies (such as routing through a configured sanitizer or requesting authorized human review).

## How it works under the hood

:::fig-claude-code-hooks:::

OpenAPPA intercepts Claude Code events through native lifecycle hooks:

- **Lifecycle interception:** The integration hooks into Claude Code's native lifecycle events (`SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, and subagent events).
- **Unified tool coverage:** Intercepts both built-in commands (`Bash`, `Read`, `Edit`, `Write`) and all external MCP tools transparently.
- **Pre-execution evaluation:** Before any tool runs, `PreToolUse` passes the call to the local APPA runtime, evaluating the flow against the session's accumulated labels (`audience × trust`).
- **Fail-closed with remedies:** Allowed actions execute immediately. Disallowed flows are blocked before execution; OpenAPPA returns the policy conflict along with actionable remedies (such as sanitizer filters or operator approval). If `appa hook` exits with code 2, Claude Code blocks the pending call. If Claude Code skips or times out the hook, the call follows its normal permission flow.
- **Session isolation:** `clappa` launches Claude Code with APPA's policy enforcement and status line. Your regular `claude` command remains completely unchanged.

## Choose protection per session

Installing OpenAPPA does not force every Claude Code session through it. Use `clappa` when you want policy enforcement. Use `claude` when you do not.

Protection belongs to the Claude Code process, not the saved conversation. Resume a protected conversation with `clappa --resume`, not `claude --resume`.
Plain `claude` starts an unprotected process.
Exit and restart a conversation already resumed through plain `claude`. It cannot become protected in place.

:::claude-session-choice:::

Projects configured with `disableAllHooks: true` disable all hooks, preventing `clappa` from enforcing policy in that session.

## Uninstall

Remove OpenAPPA's hooks and MCP registration while keeping your local policy and database:

```sh
appa plugin remove claude-code
```

To remove the integration, stop the background runtime, and purge local policies, databases, and logs:

```sh
appa plugin remove claude-code --purge
rm -f ~/.local/bin/appa
```
